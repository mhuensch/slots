<p>Why? Well, because some things are, and some things are not.</p>
<p>Why? Well, because things that are not can't be.</p>
<p>Why? Because, then nothing wouldn't be. You can't have f**king nothing isn't. Everything is!</p>
<p>Why? Cause if nothing wasn't, there'd be f**king all kinds of $h!t, like giant ants with top-hats, dancing around. There's no room for all that $h!t.</p>
<p>Why? Oh f**k you. Eat your french fries!</p>
